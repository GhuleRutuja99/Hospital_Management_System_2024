Hospital Management System made for SQL Course Project.
Hospital Management System is a flexible and easy-to-use system. A Hospital Management System is an organized computerized system designed and programmed to deal with day-to-day operations and management of hospital activities. The program can look after inpatients, outpatients, records, database treatments, status illnesses, billings in the pharmacy, and labs. It also maintains hospital information such as ward ID, doctors in charge, and department administering. The major problem for the patient nowadays is to get the report after consultation, many hospitals manage reports in their system but it's not available to the patient when he/she is outside. In this project, we are going to provide the extra facility to store the report in the database and make it available from anywhere in the world.
